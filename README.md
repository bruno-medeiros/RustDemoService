### Rust Demo Service

Learning project for creating a web-service using Rust ecosystem, as well as setting up a CI/CD pipeline.

* Main service is at `demo_svc`. Integration tests are in `demo_svc/tests` and start deps via Docker Compose.
  * ALTERNATIVE: A possible variant would be to pu integration tests in separate package?
